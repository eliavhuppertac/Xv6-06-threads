The problem is that multiple threads can access the same tables at the same time, 
and is is possible that a context switch happens right after the call to the function:

    insert(key, value, &table[i], table[i]);

where i is the same. This is actually pretty likely because it is a number modulu 5 (=the number of buckets)

And consequently we will get that they both update the head of the linked list, 
but by doing so they actually ignore the other's addition!
So we lose entried that should have been there.
